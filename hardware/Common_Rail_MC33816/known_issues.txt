 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Move C26, it's currently under an inductor. 2 parts can not sit in the same physical space
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Add via for battery wire to be attached. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.2 L1 wire leads interfere with C14 and C15. 
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Jumpers are not needed. Connect VccIO->VccIO_Ext and Clk->Y1-3
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.2 D9 had wrong footprint blah. Wrong pin numbers to wrong pins. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.2 D10 --> D10_2, and D11 --> D11_2 should be the same package, they were 2 different / wrong footprints. 
 7) RESOLVED IN R0.3 Moved several 0805 components to the back side of the PCB for lower cost assembly.
 8)                  J15 needs silk and larger hole. J20 needs silk and should use same larger terminal as J8-J9-J10
 9)                  J15 & J20 silk ^^^ should be on both top and bottom sides of the board
10)                  power LED. back side is pretty much free pre-assembled, front side is manual assembly. maybe one LED on each side?
11)                  J5&J6 why do we need as jumpers? Shall we connect those permanently since looks like those shall be connected?
12)                  move more small stuff to same (back) side
13)                  Fix courtyard warnings on back side, move components slightly.
