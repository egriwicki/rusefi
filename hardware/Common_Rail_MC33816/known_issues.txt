 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Move C26, it's currently under an inductor. 2 parts can not sit in the same physical space
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Add via for battery wire to be attached. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.2 L1 wire leads interfere with C14 and C15. 
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.2 Jumpers are not needed. Connect VccIO->VccIO_Ext and Clk->Y1-3
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.2 D9 had wrong footprint blah. Wrong pin numbers to wrong pins. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.2 D10 --> D10_2, and D11 --> D11_2 should be the same package, they were 2 different / wrong footprints. 

 2) RESOLVED IN R0.3 Moved several 0805 components to the back side of the PCB for lower cost assembly.
