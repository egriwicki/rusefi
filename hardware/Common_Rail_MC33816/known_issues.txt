 1) RESOLVED IN R0.2   Move C26, it's currently under an inductor. 2 parts can not sit in the same physical space
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.2   Add via for battery wire to be attached. 
 3) RESOLVED IN R0.2   L1 wire leads interfere with C14 and C15. 
 4) RESOLVED IN R0.2   Jumpers are not needed. Connect VccIO->VccIO_Ext and Clk->Y1-3
 5) RESOLVED IN R0.2   D9 had wrong footprint blah. Wrong pin numbers to wrong pins. 
 6) RESOLVED IN R0.2   D10 --> D10_2, and D11 --> D11_2 should be the same package, they were 2 different / wrong footprints. 
 7) RESOLVED IN R0.3   Moved several 0805 components to the back side of the PCB for lower cost assembly.
 8) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 J15 needs silk and larger hole. J20 needs silk and should use same larger terminal as J8-J9-J10
 9) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 J15 & J20 silk ^^^ should be on both top and bottom sides of the board
10) See 14             power LED. back side is pretty much free pre-assembled, front side is manual assembly. maybe one LED on each side?
11) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 J5&J6 why do we need as jumpers? Shall we connect those permanently since looks like those shall be connected?
12) See 14             move more small stuff to same (back) side
13) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 Fix courtyard warnings on back side, move components slightly. 
14) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 The current board layout is very hard to work with - can we please have all components on top? PCB space cost nothing comparing with the stress of flipping and poking
15) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 Noxz is asking to move C21 to next to C22
16) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 terminals usability is asking for improvements. Ideally can we move more terminals to the edge of the board? ADDED TP2, TP3, TP4, TP5, TP7, TP7, and TP8 
17) RESOLVED IN R0.3.2 Add many LED's for easier diagnostics like PT2000 board. 
18)
