 1) RESOLVED IN R0.1.1 Schematic zone G4 and G5, blue text claims INJ5 as INJ3, and INJ6 as INJ4
 2) RESOLVED IN R0.1.1 Schematic inj1 and 2 are flipped, nets are flipped. Change net names and correct blue silk screen note. 
 3)                    Add silk screen to designate injector # and similar. 
 4)                  Move C26, it's currently under an inductor. 2 parts can not sit in the same physical space
 5)                  Add via for battery wire to be attached. 
 6)                  check for flipped pins. pins 39 and 50 are wrong.  
 7)                  ?D2?, D11_1, D10, D10_1, D11 and D11_2 are likely botched. Check them against MC33816 R0.2 layout. dual package into one package
 8)                  D9 is likely botched, wrong footprint pins, verify against MC33816 R0.2 layout.
