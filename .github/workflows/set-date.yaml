name: Set Date

# Run once every day
# If we run it on schedule, but only change the date stamp if the repo has changed, The date could be behind by up to a day.
# We can't really try to change it with every push the way workflows are set up now,
#  because there is no way to control which workflows run first, so some builds will not have the updated date and will lag behind by one build.
# https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#triggering-new-workflows-using-a-personal-access-token
#  "When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks on behalf of the GitHub Actions app,
#  events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run."
