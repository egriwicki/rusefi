All notable user-facing or behavior-altering changes will be doucmented in this file.

## Nov 2020 Release

### Breaking Changes
 -   "AFR target" table is now "Lambda target" table.  It should convert itself correctly, but a backup of that table is recommended when updating firmware/ini.
 -   "Base cranking fuel" is now in milligrams, using the full injector model at all times now.  60mg per liter per cylinder is a good starting point

### Added
 -   High & low pressure fuel sensor channels
 -   Electronic throttle-style wastegate control found on some VW turbos (and VGTs)
