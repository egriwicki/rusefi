```rusefi*.ini``` files are generated based on the following four inputs:
1) ```rusefi_config.txt``` contains configuration region definition in proprietary text format.
2) ```rusefi.input``` contains the UI - all the menus and dialogs. UI definition starts at ```menuDialog = main```
line - here you will see all top level menus defined with internal IDs and visible text labels.
3) ```mapping.yaml``` is a minor detail related to how pins are named in drop downs
4) ```prepend.txt``` is a minor detail which allows you to hide elements of the UI using ```@@if_XXX``` syntax.


rusefi.ini file is generated by ConfigDefinition.jar tool.
On Windows you simply invoke ```gen_config.bat```
